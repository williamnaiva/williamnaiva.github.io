		<h1> A wiener dog </h1>
		<p> The dachshund (UK: /ˈdæksənd, ˈdæʃ-, -hʊnd, -hʊnt/ DAKS-ənd, DASH-, -⁠huund, -⁠huunt or US: /ˈdɑːkshʊnt, -sənt/ DAHKS-huunt, -⁠ənt[2][3][4])
		(German: "badger dog"), also known as the wiener dog is a short-legged, long-bodied, 
		hound-type dog breed. They may be smooth-haired, wire-haired, or long-haired. The standard-size dachshund was developed to scent, chase, and flush out badgers and other burrow-dwelling animals,
		while the miniature dachshund was bred to hunt smaller prey such as rabbits. In the Western United States, they have also been used to track
		wounded deer and hunt prairie dogs.Dachshunds also participate in conformation shows, field trials and many other events organized through
		pure-bred dog organizations such as the American Kennel Club (AKC). According to the AKC, the dachshund is ranked in 13th place in
		popularity amongst dog breeds in the United States.[5]
